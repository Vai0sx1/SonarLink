# SonarLink: A Decentralized Music Platform on the Blockchain

SonarLink is a decentralized music platform built on the Ethereum blockchain, empowering artists and fans alike. It utilizes NFTs to represent songs, enabling secure ownership, transparent royalties, and a vibrant marketplace for music and related assets.  This platform also offers features for playlists, premium subscriptions, live event ticketing, and social interaction.


## Core Features:

* **NFT Music Representation:** Songs are tokenized as NFTs, giving artists verifiable ownership and enabling fractional ownership or licensing.
* **Transparent Royalties:**  Royalty payments are automatically distributed to artists upon song purchases and plays, ensuring fair compensation.
* **Premium Subscription Model:**  Users can subscribe for ad-free music streaming and access to exclusive content.
* **Playlist Creation & Management:**  Users can create and manage personal playlists, curating their favorite tracks.
* **Music Licensing:**  Artists can offer various licenses for their music, generating additional revenue streams.
* **Live Event Ticketing:**  Facilitates the sale of tickets for live music events, directly linking to artists' earnings.
* **Social Features:**  Includes basic social features like following/unfollowing artists and commenting on songs.
* **Copyright Registration:**  Allows for the registration and sale of song copyrights.
* **Decentralized Governance:**  Contract ownership is transferable and offers control over key parameters.
* **Pausable:**  The contract can be paused in case of emergency, providing a safety mechanism.


## Smart Contract Functionality:

The `SonarLink` contract manages the core functionality, including:

* **`registerSong(...)`:** Registers a new song as an NFT, setting its metadata and price.  Only the contract owner can initially register songs.
* **`purchaseSong(...)`:** Allows users to purchase songs as NFTs.  Royalties and commissions are automatically distributed.
* **`playSong(...)`:** Enables song playback; premium subscribers have ad-free access.
* **`purchasePremiumSubscription(...)`:** Allows users to purchase a premium subscription.
* **`createPlaylist(...)`:** Enables the creation of user playlists.
* **`addSongToPlaylist(...)` & `removeSongFromPlaylist(...)`:** Adds and removes songs from playlists.
* **`addLicenseToSong(...)` & `purchaseLicense(...)`:**  Allows artists to create and sell licenses for their songs.
* **`createLiveEvent(...)`, `cancelLiveEvent(...)`, `purchaseLiveEventTicket(...)`:**  Manages the creation, cancellation, and purchasing of tickets for live events.
* **`followUser(...)` & `unfollowUser(...)`:** Basic social interaction features.
* **`rateSong(...)` & `commentSong(...)`:**  Allows users to rate and comment on songs.
* **`registerCopyright(...)` & `purchaseCopyright(...)`:**  Enables copyright registration and sale.
* **`withdraw()`:** Allows the contract owner to withdraw funds.
* **`pause()` & `unpause()`:**  Pauses and unpauses the contract functionality.


## Deployment and Usage:

**1. Deployment:**

* **Prerequisites:** Solidity development environment (Remix, Hardhat, Truffle), Ethereum network (mainnet or testnet), and the address of an ERC-20 token (e.g., WETH) for transactions.
* **Compilation:** Compile the `SonarLink.sol` contract.
* **Deployment:** Deploy the contract, providing the ERC-20 token address.


**2. Interaction:**

Interact with the contract via a web3 interface or development tool.  The functions listed above provide the core interactions.


**3. Considerations:**

* The contract owner initially has the sole ability to register new songs; consider mechanisms for onboarding new artists.
*  Off-chain storage (like IPFS) is recommended for storing large song files and artwork.
*  Consider adding more sophisticated social features and user profiles.
*  Security audits are strongly recommended before deploying to mainnet.


## Requirements:

* Solidity development environment (Remix, Hardhat, Truffle).
* Ethereum network (mainnet or testnet).
* An ERC-20 token for transactions.
